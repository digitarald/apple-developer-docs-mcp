# Apple Developer Docs MCP Server

I despise reading docs on https://developer.apple.com.  This MCP server will do that for you.

## Usage

#### .vscode/mcp.json
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "apple-developer-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "apple-developer-docs-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
